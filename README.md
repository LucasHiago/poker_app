## About

This app is based on classic Texas Hold'em Poker and is made for two players.
Built with React/Redux.

## What is completed.
* Rough design and layout
* Game state
* Basic game flow
* Initial chat
* Algorithms to check player hands

## What still needs to be done
* Style needs to be better developed eg. replace hardcoded styles with responsive designs
* Algorithm bug testing
* Finalize game flow eg. Show hands => determine winner => distribute chips => reset state => reshuffle => deal
* Client/Host networking
* Back-end stuff eg. db's and d3.js integration
* Flow integration for stricter type specifications



## Current Problems
* Flow integration. Not necessary but desirable.
* CSS needs to better thought out.
